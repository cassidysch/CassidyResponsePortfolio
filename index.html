          ignore the obvious. Live a normal life. It's hard enough just to do that in this world." (Page 36, Butler)
          <br><br> My quote is taken from early on in the story when Lauren expresses a sense of alienation from her
          community because she feels that there is an impending danger that nobody else seems to recognize.<br>A major
          concept in this is this motif of otherness and Lauren's feelings of isolation from her community.<br>I wrote a
          song on my guitar and added lyrics to symbolize the distance that Lauren feels. In my song, I chose to use two
          notes that switched back and forth on the high E string, which symbolizes the dichotomy between Lauren and her
          community. I also chose to use four descending notes on the B string that show how Lauren wishes that she
          could assimilate to her community's way of thinking, but ultimately fails and continues to stay in this kind
          of spiral that distances herself from her family and community.<br>In my lyrics, I wrote the line "I'm
          watching the flowers wilt," which symbolizes how Lauren feels like she's watching this beautiful thing fall
          apart and come closer and closer to utter tragedy. I also wrote "Bury the hatchet, and then they'll say I'm
          staring into the sun." I intended to try and represent how everyone around Lauren feels about her paranoid
          ideas and talk of doom. Her father and her friend both feel that she's only going to bring harm the more she
          talks about her ideas, thus the line about "staring into the sun."

        <p class="littleaboutmetext"><b>Evidence from the text:</b> "'No,' he said. 'Of course not. But we don't have to
          turn into animals, for godsake.'" (Butler, 188)<br><br>My evidence is taken from the part of the story when
          Harry, Zahra, and Lauren get into an argument about how to approach life outside of the neighborhood walls. At
          this point, they were newly displaced from their community and now have to rationale with how to treat those
          around them and what kinds of things they might have to do to stay alive and safe.<br>My artistic response is
          mostly centered around this concept of distrust and how much empathy for other people do you have to give up
          in Lauren and Harry's world. I chose to write the song mostly from Lauren's perspective and said things like
          "I'm not going back home" and "'Cause I'm sure, I'm not going anywhere" to symbolize her stubborness about
          having to leave the comforts of the neighborhood behind and move forward. She knows that they can never return
          to the same kind of dignity that they all held for themselves and each other in the neighborhood and there's
          no turning back.<br>I also chose to write "Every fork in the road is the same old story, I know," which
          symbolizes how Lauren believes that every option they have in any given interaction with another group of
          people or another person is almost always guaranteed to be dangerous and that it is critical to keep
          suspicion.<br>In my instrumental, I used this descending note progression that goes hand in hand with the idea
          of waves that was mentioned in the lyrics because I wanted to show how Lauren and her group are trapped in
          this cycle where they have to continue to make tough decisions about who to trust and how to react. In the
          second descending set of notes, I have one note that sounds kind of dissonant and much more melancholy than
          the rest of the progression, which is intentionally placed to show the bitterness and sorrow of the world
          outside Lauren's neighborhood and add something a little sour to a song that already resolves.</p>

          <b>Evidence from the text:</b> "'I need you to understand me,' I said. 'I need you to take me the way I am or go off to your land by yourself.'" (Butler, 281)
          <br><br>
          <b>Motif:</b> I used Lauren's personality as the guiding concept in my work and more specifically how she tends to isolate herself from those around her and how she is very selective and careful about who she trusts and who she lets in.
          <br><br>
          For my artistic response, I wrote and recorded a song on guitar and then passed it on to Luciano, who animated a music video to go with the song. In my song, titled "This Place I'll Call Home," I wrote the lyric "I've already decided my fate" because Lauren feels very secure and confident in her future with Earthseed and has no desire to bend to the will of those around her, even people she cares about. I also wrote the lyric "And there's no place quite like this" because I wanted to convey how this beautiful future that she's created in her mind has really impacted her decision making and the way that she engages with everyone around her. She's always planning towards developing Earthseed and is very excited about it. I also wrote "Saying goodbye is the greatest heartache, but it won't be for me" and I wanted to try to convey the morality she wrestles with whenever she has to consider whether to trust an outsider or whether to outcast them. On one hand, she's going to figure out how to get Earthseed off the ground no matter who she has to say goodbye to or part ways with, but she also genuinely cares about those around her and those in her community. I made the choice to have the notes descend on only the low E string and stay the same on the G and B strings, which adds simplicity to the instrumental because I wanted to show how rigid and unwavering Lauren is in her belief system and aspirations.
