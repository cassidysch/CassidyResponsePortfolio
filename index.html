        <p class="littleaboutmetext"><b>Evidence from the text:</b> "Even so, why can't I do what others have done - ignore the obvious. Live a normal life. It's hard enough just to do that in this world." (Page 36, Butler) <br><br> My quote is taken from early on in the story when Lauren expresses a sense of alienation from her community because she feels that there is an impending danger that nobody else seems to recognize.<br>A major concept in this is this motif of otherness and Lauren's feelings of isolation from her community.<br>I wrote a song on my guitar and added lyrics to symbolize the distance that Lauren feels. In my song, I chose to use two notes that switched back and forth on the high E string, which symbolizes the dichotomy between Lauren and her community. I also chose to use four descending notes on the B string that show how Lauren wishes that she could assimilate to her community's way of thinking, but ultimately fails and continues to stay in this kind of spiral that distances herself from her family and community.<br>In my lyrics, I wrote the line "I'm watching the flowers wilt," which symbolizes how Lauren feels like she's watching this beautiful thing fall apart and come closer and closer to utter tragedy. I also wrote "Bury the hatchet, and then they'll say I'm staring into the sun." I intended to try and represent how everyone around Lauren feels about her paranoid ideas and talk of doom. Her father and her friend both feel that she's only going to bring harm the more she talks about her ideas, thus the line about "staring into the sun."</p>
